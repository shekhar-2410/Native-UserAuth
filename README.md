# Native User Authentication App with AccessToken and Firebase
This repository contains a simple mobile application for user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and Firebase. The app provides a seamless user experience with native navigation components like Stack Navigator and Drawer Navigator. Additionally, user credentials are securely stored using AsyncStorage, and Firebase is used for backend database functionality.

# Features
User Registration: Users can create an account by providing their email and password, with registration data securely stored in Firebase.
User Login: Registered users can log in with their credentials, and Firebase authentication is used to verify user identities.
JWT Token Authentication: The app uses JWT tokens for secure user authentication, providing an extra layer of security.
Stack Navigator: Implements a stack-based navigation system for seamless transitions between screens.
Drawer Navigator: Offers a user-friendly navigation menu accessible from the side.
Secure Storage: User credentials are stored securely using AsyncStorage.
